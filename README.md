We provide access to both the data and code used in the study involving model development and validation. The repository includes the following files, each with a distinct purpose:
* **development_code.ipynb** : This jupyter notebook file contains the complete coding journey of our study, spanning from initial model development to the subsequent analytical phases.
* **df_size_2308.csv, df_depth_2308.csv** : These files comprise the final datasets used in the study for size and depth models, respectively.
