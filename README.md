## Running title: AI for pediatric size and depth

We provide access to both the data and code used in the study involving model development and validation. The repository includes the following files, each with a distinct purpose:
* **development_code.ipynb** : This jupyter notebook file contains the complete coding journey of our study, spanning from initial model development to the subsequent analytical phases.
* **df_size_2308.csv, df_depth_2308.csv** : These files comprise the final datasets used in the study for size and depth models, respectively.
* **development_size.py, development_depth.py** : These Python files contain code snippets designed for loading input data and training gradient-boosted regression tree models.
